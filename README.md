# VDSS - Vehicle Dynamics Safety Simulator

## Overview
VDSS provides a MATLAB based environment for simulating vehicle dynamics and safety scenarios. The top level `VDSS` function sets up the user interface, loads vehicle configurations and executes simulations through the `SimManager` class. The design follows a modular approach where each toolbox encapsulates a specific subsystem (e.g., controls, physics, plotting). Users can modify parameters or replace components without rewriting the entire simulator.

## Quick Start
1. Open MATLAB and add this repository to the path with `addpath(genpath(pwd))`.
2. Run `VDSS` to launch the graphical interface and start a default simulation.
3. Use the menu options to load vehicle parameter files, start/stop runs and save results.
4. The `Simulations` directory contains several ready-made examples. Open any MAT file there and click **Run** to reproduce the scenario.

## Directory Structure
- `Source/` – MATLAB toolboxes that implement the simulator.
- `Scripts/` – Utility scripts and MEX wrappers.
- `Simulations/` – Example configurations and output data.
- `Curves/` – Acceleration, braking and steering profiles used by the controllers.
- `tests/` – Unit tests for core algorithms.
- `codegen/` – Generated binaries when MEX wrappers are built.
- `VDSS.m` – Entry point that constructs the GUI and orchestrates components.

## Toolboxes
### Plotting
`PlotManager` and `VehiclePlotter` create figures, animate trajectories and manage overlays. Typical use is:
```matlab
pm = PlotManager();
pm.createFigure('Position', [100 100 800 600]);
VehiclePlotter.plotVehicle(pm, vehicleState);
```
The plots update in real time as the simulation runs.

### GUI
`UIManager` builds the main window and configuration tabs while `DataManager` stores simulation data shared across modules. Widgets allow editing parameters live and displaying simulation status.

### Vehicle Model
`VehicleModel` aggregates all controllers and mechanical subsystems. `VehicleParameters` defines default masses and geometry. `VehicleGUIManager` links GUI widgets to model fields. A vehicle instance is assembled from building blocks like engine, transmission, suspension and tire objects. Relationships among components are shown below:
```
[Engine] --torque--> [Transmission] --force--> [Tires] --grip--> [Chassis]
```

### Simulation
`SimManager` orchestrates vehicle instances, runs the physics engine and handles collision detection. Time integration occurs inside `runStep`, which updates every vehicle and the 3‑D world.

### Mapping
`LaneMap` holds waypoint data and `VehicleLocalizer` computes curvature for path following. Maps can be generated programmatically using `mapCommands` strings or loaded from CSV files.

### Configuration
`ConfigurationManager` saves and loads XML configurations and simulation results. Each configuration captures parameter sets, map commands and run logs for later replay.

### Physics
Includes `KinematicsCalculator`, `ForceCalculator`, `DynamicsUpdater`, `CollisionDetector`, `VehicleCollisionSeverity`, `SurfaceFrictionManager` and `StabilityChecker`. These functions can be compiled to MEX for faster execution via `Scripts/Wrappers/generate_mex`. Key equations:
- Wheel slip ratio: `\kappa = (\omega R - v_x) / \max(v_x, 0.1)`
- Lateral slip angle: `\alpha = \tan^{-1}(v_y / |v_x|)`
- Aerodynamic drag: `F_d = 0.5 C_d A \rho v^2`

### Graphics
Objects such as `Vehicle3D`, `Road3D` and `World3D` render 3‑D scenes for the optional `Sim3DAnimator`. Screenshots may be saved automatically at each frame for later video generation.

### Mechanics
Contains drivetrain and suspension models (`Engine`, `Transmission`, `BrakeSystem`, `Clutch`, `LeafSpringSuspension`, `Pacejka96TireModel`, etc.). The tire model uses the Pacejka 1996 formula:
```
F_y = D \sin(C \tan^{-1}(B\alpha - E(B\alpha - \tan^{-1}(B\alpha))))
```
where `B`, `C`, `D` and `E` are stiffness parameters.

### Control
Adaptive cruise (`acc_Controller`), PID and jerk controllers, lateral/longitudinal limiters and the `purePursuit_PathFollower` are implemented here. Controllers output throttle, brake and steering commands each cycle.

### Tests
MATLAB test functions under `tests/` validate controllers, vehicle dynamics and localization routines. Run `runtests('tests')` inside MATLAB to execute all unit tests.

## Parameters
`VehicleModel.initializeDefaultParameters` exposes many tunable values. Key groups include:
- **Basic Configuration:** trailer inclusion, masses, initial velocity and inertia multipliers.
- **Geometry:** lengths, widths, center-of-gravity heights, wheelbase and track widths.
- **Tire & Suspension:** tire sizes, pressure matrices and spring/damping constants.
- **Engine & Transmission:** maximum torque, gear ratios, shift speeds and clutch behaviour.
- **Controllers:** PID gains, acceleration/steering limits and maximum speed.
- **Road & Environment:** slope angle, friction coefficient, aerodynamic drag and wind settings.

Example snippet:
```matlab
params.tractorMass = 8000;      % kg
params.trailerMass = 7000;      % kg
params.maxSpeed = 25.0;         % m/s speed limiter
params.Kp = 1.0;                % PID proportional gain
params.gearRatios = [14.94 11.21 8.31 6.26 ...];
```

## Capabilities
- Simulate two vehicles with optional trailers in parallel.
- Detect and report collisions and severity metrics.
- Visualize runs in 2‑D or 3‑D including articulated trailers.
- Export logs and configurations to XML, CSV, MAT and PNG files.
- Generate lane maps on the fly from command strings.

## Command Inputs and Track Generation
`VehicleModel` exposes several command strings to automate test cases:
- **`mapCommands`** – a `|` separated list describing lane segments.
  - `straight(x1,y1,x2,y2)` adds a straight from `(x1,y1)` to `(x2,y2)`.
  - `curve(cx,cy,r,theta1,theta2,dir)` adds an arc around `(cx,cy)` with radius `r` from `theta1` to `theta2` degrees. `dir` is `cw` or `ccw`.
  - Example:
    ```matlab
    params.mapCommands = "straight(100,200,300,200)|curve(300,250,50,270,90,ccw)";
    map = LaneMap(400,400);
    map = map.processLaneCommands(params.mapCommands);
    map.plotLaneMapWithCommands(gca, params.mapCommands, 'k');
    ```
- **`steeringCommands` / `accelerationCommands`** – sequences like `"time angle; ..."` or `"time accel; ..."` that set steering angles or throttle percentages at specific times. These strings are interpreted by `VehicleGUIManager` and forwarded to controllers.
- **`tirePressureCommands`** – adjusts individual tire pressures during a run.
- **`flatTireIndices`** – vector of tire indices that should fail. `ForceCalculator` reduces Pacejka stiffness and friction for these wheels, effectively simulating a blow‑out.

## Collision Analysis
`VehicleCollisionSeverity` estimates delta‑V values using SAE&nbsp;J2980 tables. For heavy trucks the thresholds scale with kinetic energy:
```matlab
scale = sqrt(J2980AssumedMaxMass / vehicleMass);
thresholds = baseDV * scale;  % baseDV from J2980 table
```
Collision energy is computed as `0.5 * m * \Delta v^2` and compared with severity thresholds. This extension allows comparing truck crashes against J2980 passenger‑car limits by specifying `J2980AssumedMaxMass` in the GUI.

## Physics Models
The simulator models vehicle dynamics with:
- **Pacejka '96 tire model** (`Pacejka96TireModel`) for lateral and longitudinal forces. Flat tires modify the Pacejka parameters to reduce stiffness and peak grip.
- **Runge–Kutta 4 integrator** (`DynamicsUpdater.updateStateRK4`) for state propagation each time step.
- **KinematicsCalculator** for coordinate transforms and velocity derivatives.
- **ForceCalculator** which sums traction, braking, aerodynamic and suspension forces before updating the dynamics.
- **Energy balance** for collision analysis: `E_k = 0.5 * m * v^2`.

## Signal Filtering
- **Moving average filters** smooth transmission shift logic and force outputs in `Transmission` and `ForceCalculator` (window sizes configurable).
- **Gaussian filter** plus **low‑pass filter** smooth steering commands inside `purePursuit_PathFollower`.

These filters reduce noise and abrupt changes in the generated commands for more stable simulations.
